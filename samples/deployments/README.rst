Rally Deployments
=================

Rally needs to have information about OpenStack Cloud before you actually
can run any tests against it.

You need create a deployment input file and run use command bellow:

.. code-block::

    rally deployment create --file <one_of_files_from_this_dir> --name my_cloud

Below you can find samples of supported configurations.

existing.json
-------------

Register existing OpenStack cluster.

existing-keystone-v3.json
-------------------------

Register existing OpenStack cluster that uses Keystone v3.

existing-with-predefined-users.json
------------------------------------

If you are using read-only backend in Keystone like LDAP, AD then
you need this sample. If you don't specify "users" rally will use already
existing users that you provide.

existing-keystone-v3-user.json
------------------------------

Register an exisitng OpenStack cluster that uses Keystone v3 and a non-privileged user. The use of an admin account is optional because most tests can use a normal account.

existing-api.json
-----------------

If you expect to specify version of some clients, you could register existing
Openstack cluster like this sample.
